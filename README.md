# COVID-19-Diagnosis
Developed a COVID-19 Diagnosis Software using C#, which is a programming language commonly used for Windows applications. The software is designed to help diagnose COVID-19 by analyzing symptoms and providing a recommendation on whether the person should seek medical attention or not.
The software uses a decision tree algorithm and machine learning techniques to improve accuracy in diagnosis. It also includes a database of COVID-19 symptoms and statistics to aid in the diagnosis process. The software has potential to assist healthcare professionals and the general public in diagnosing and managing COVID-19 cases, and may contribute to reducing the spread of the virus.
